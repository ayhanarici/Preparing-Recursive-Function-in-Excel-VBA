# Preparing-Recursive-Function-in-Excel-VBA
<p>In this example, we will examine how to do the Fibonacci series calculation, the classic of the Recursive functions, using Excel VBA. My purpose in preparing this example is to experience that we can write our own functions in Excel and have some fun. I hope it will be a useful example.
First, we open our Excel program. Then, by pressing the Alt+F11 hotkey, we open the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications window. We add a new module with the Module command from the Insert menu. We write the codes of our function. Finally, we return to the Excel program and test our function. Examples of usage of the function are as follows.<br></p>

<b>
=ARC_FIBONACCI(9)<br>
=ARC_FIBONACCI(A1)
